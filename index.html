        <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
        <p>
            The existing check-in process at Moringa is encumbered by multiple difficulties. Firstly, it is notably time-consuming, leading to delays in operations. Secondly, the reliance on manual data entry for student information introduces a significant risk of errors and inaccuracies, including the possibility of typos in names or student IDs. Lastly, the current manual system lacks the capability to provide comprehensive insights into student attendance patterns, making it challenging to identify trends such as late arrivals or frequent absences.

        <h2>Problem Solution:</h2>
        <p>
            We propose developing the "Moringa Check-in System," a web-based solution that addresses these challenges:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Efficient Check-In: The website automates the check-in process, allowing accurate records of attendance of students using a user-friendly interface.</li>
            <li>Error Reduction: By eliminating manual data entry, the system reduces the risk of errors in student information.</li>
            <li>Attendance Insights: The website generates reports and statistics, providing administrators with valuable insights into student attendance trends and patterns.</li>
            <li>Time Savings: Automation frees up administrators' time, enabling them to focus on higher-priority tasks.</li>
            <li>Security: User authentication ensures that only authorized individuals, including administrators and security guards, have access to student check-in data.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Minimum Viable Product (MVP):</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Student Registration Form: A web form that allows students details to be registered, including full name, ID number, phone number, laptop model, serial number, TM (Teaching Mentor), and course. Validation checks to ensure data accuracy.</li>
            <li>Student Check-In Interface: An interface for students to check in using their registered information. Real-time recording of arrival. Option to specify room number for check-in.</li>
            <li>Teaching Mentor (TM) Management: A section for administrators to manage TMs, including adding, editing, and removing mentors.</li>
            <li>User Authentication and Role-Based Access: User authentication for administrators, and security guards.</li>
            <li>User-Friendly UI/UX: A user-friendly and intuitive interface for all users. Clear and simple design for ease of use.</li>
            <li>Reports and Statistics: Generation of reports and statistics on student attendance trends and patterns. Visual representations of data for straightforward interpretation.</li>
        </ul>
